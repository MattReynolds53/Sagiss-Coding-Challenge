## Description

For this applicaiton, I created a RESTful API that can get/create/update/delete user data from a persistence database. The database sotes information about a user such as his or her full name, date of birth, address, personal ID number, and personal description. Upon creating an instance of a individual in the database, the user can then manipulate that information however he or she pleases.

<div id="installation"></div>

## Installation

When the user opens this application, he or she can enter 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. Then the user can enter 'npm run dev' to open a live server that will adjust whenever changes are amde to the code to avoid having to stop and start the server each time a change is made.

<div id="usage"></div>

## Usage

When exploring this application, users can navigate throughout the database through various endpoints. If a user enters 'npm run dev' in the integrated terminal, he or she can then access the endpoints through an application like Insomnia in order to get/create/update/delete users in the database.
